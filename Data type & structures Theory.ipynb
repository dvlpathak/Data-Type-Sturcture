    "Q1: What are data structures, and why are they important?\n",
    "A: Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data efficiently to perform operations like retrieval, insertion, and deletion effectively. They are essential for managing large data sets and improving the performance of algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples.\n",
    "A: Mutable data types can be changed after creation (e.g., lists, dictionaries, sets).\n",
    "Immutable data types cannot be changed once created (e.g., strings, tuples, integers).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n",
    "A: Lists are mutable and can be modified after creation, while tuples are immutable and cannot be changed once created.\n",
    "Lists use more memory and are slower for iteration compared to tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: Describe how dictionaries store data.\n",
    "A: Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs using a hash table. Each key is unique, and values are accessed quickly by looking up their keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
    "A: Sets automatically remove duplicates and allow fast membership testing, making them useful when you need to store unique elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6: What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
    "A: A string is an immutable sequence of characters, while a list is a mutable sequence that can contain different data types.\n",
    "Strings cannot be modified after creation; lists can be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7: How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
    "A: Tuples are immutable, meaning their data cannot be changed once created. This prevents accidental modifications and ensures data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8: What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
    "A: A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function.\n",
    "Python dictionaries use hash tables internally for fast key-based access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9: Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
    "A: Yes, Python lists can contain elements of different data types, such as integers, strings, floats, or even other lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10: Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n",
    "A: Strings are immutable to improve performance, memory efficiency, and security. Once created, a string cannot be changed, which allows for safe sharing between different parts of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11: What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
    "A: Dictionaries provide faster lookup times (O(1) average) when accessing data by key, and they store data in meaningful key-value pairs, which is more efficient for certain tasks than using lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12: Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n",
    "A: Use a tuple when you need a collection of items that should not change, such as representing a point in coordinates (x, y) or storing constant data like days of the week.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q13: How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
    "A: Sets automatically remove duplicates. If duplicate elements are added to a set, only one instance of each unique element is stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q14: How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
    "A: In lists, the \"in\" keyword checks if a value exists in the list.\n",
    "In dictionaries, \"in\" checks if a key exists, not the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q15: Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not.\n",
    "A: No, you cannot modify elements of a tuple because tuples are immutable. Once created, their elements are fixed and cannot be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q16: What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case.\n",
    "A: A nested dictionary is a dictionary where values are themselves dictionaries.\n",
    "Example: Storing employee records with multiple details under each ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "employees = {\n",
    "  101: {\"name\": \"John\", \"role\": \"Developer\"},\n",
    "  102: {\"name\": \"Alice\", \"role\": \"Manager\"}\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q17: Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary.\n",
    "A: Accessing an element in a dictionary has an average time complexity of O(1), thanks to the hash table implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q18: In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
    "A:Lists are preferred when you need to store ordered data, allow duplicates, or when the order of elements matters. Lists are also better for sequential data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q19: Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
    "A: Historically, dictionaries were unordered, meaning the order of insertion was not preserved. Since Python 3.7, insertion order is preserved, but data retrieval is still based on keys, not order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q20: Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n",
    "A: In lists, elements are retrieved by their index (position).\n",
    "In dictionaries, elements are retrieved by keys, which allows for faster and more meaningful data access when dealing with key-value pairs."
